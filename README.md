# Ensemble-Learning-For-Cyber-Attack
An Ensemble Learning For Enhanced Cyber Attack Detection
Built an ensemble-based intrusion detection system using SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes with soft voting to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. The system supports real-time packet capture (Pyshark), automated SMTP alerts, and a live monitoring dashboard. Backend built with Flask, SQLite, and Scikit-learn, enabling secure authentication, model retraining, and attack log management. Achieved 98.2% detection accuracy on the CICIDS2017 dataset.
